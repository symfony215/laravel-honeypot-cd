When adding a form to a public site there a risk that spam bots will try to submit it with fake values. Luckily most of these bots are pretty dumb. You can thwart most of them by adding a field to your form that should not contain a value when submitted. Such a field is called a honeypot. Most bots will just fill all fields, including the honeypot.  When a request comes in with a filled honeypot, this package will discard that request.

After installing this package all you need to do is to add a `@honeypot` Blade directive to your form.

```html
<form method="POST">
    @honeypot
    <input name="myField" type="text">
</form>
```

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require spatie/laravel-honeypot
```

Optionally, you can publish the config file of the package.

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Spatie\Honeypot\HoneypotServiceProvider --tags=config"
```

This is the content of the config file that will be published at `config/honeypot.php`:

```php
use Spatie\Honeypot\SpamResponder\BlankPageResponder;

return [

    /*
     * Here you can specify name of the honeypot field. Any requests that submit a non-empty
     * value for this name will be discarded. Make sure this name does not
     * collide with a form field that is actually used.
     */
    'name_field_name' => 'my_name',

    /*
     * This field contains the name of a form field that will be use to verify
     * if the form wasn't submitted too quickly. Make sure this name does not
     * collide with a form field that is actually used.
     */
    'valid_from_field_name' => 'valid_from',

    /*
     * If the form is submitted faster then this amout of seconds
     * the form submission will be considered invalid.
     */
    'amount_of_seconds' => 1,

    /*
     * This class is responsible for sending a response to request that
     * are detected as being spammy. By default a blank page is shown.
     *
     * A valid responder is any class that implements
     * `Spatie\Honeypot\SpamResponder\SpamResponder`
     */
    'respond_to_spam_with' => BlankPageResponder::class,

    /*
     * This switch determines if the honeypot protection should be activated.
     */
    'enabled' => true,
];
```
  
## Usage

First you must add the `@honeypot` blade directive to any form you wish to protect.

```php
<form method="POST" action="{{ action(App\Http\Controllers\ContactFormSubmissionController::class, 'create') }}")>
    @honeypot
    <input name="myField" type="text">
</form>
```

`@honeypot` will add two fields: `my_name` and `my_time` (you can change the names in the config file).

Next, you must use the `Spatie\Honeypot\ProtectAgainstSpam` middleware the route that handles the form submission. This middleware will intercept any request that submits a non empty value for the key named `my_name`. It will also intercept the request if it is submitted faster than the encrypted timestamp that the package generated in `my_time`.

```php
use App\Http\Controllers\ContactFormSubmissionController;
use Spatie\Honeypot\ProtectAgainstSpam;

Route::post([ContactFormSubmissionController::class, 'create'])->middleware(ProtectAgainstSpam::class);
```

If your app has a lot of forms handled by many different controllors, you could opt to register it as global middleware.

```php
// inside app\Http\Kernel.php

protected $middleware = [
   // ...
   ProtectAgainstSpam::class,
];
```

### Disabling in testing

By default any protected form that is submitted in faster than 1 second will be marked as spammy. When running end to end tests, which should run as fast as possible, you probably don't want this. 

To disable all honeypots in code you can set the `enabled` config value to `false`.

```php
config()->set('honeypot.enabled', false)
```

### Customizing the response

When a spammy submission is detected the package will show a blank page by default. You can customize this behaviour by writing your own `SpamResponse` and specifying it's fully qualified class name in the `respond_to_spam_with` key of the `honeypot` config file.

A valid `SpamResponse` is any class that implements the `Spatie\Honeypot\SpamResponder\SpamResponder` interface. This is what that interface looks like:

```php
namespace Spatie\Honeypot\SpamResponder;

use Closure;
use Illuminate\Http\Request;

interface SpamResponser
{
    public function respond(Request $request, Closure $next);
}
```

Even though a spam responders primary purpose is to respond to spammy requests, you could do other stuff there as well. You could for instance use the properties on `$request` to determine the source of the spam (maybe all requests come from the same IP) and put some logic to block that source altogether.

If the package wrongly determined that the request is spammy you can generate the default response by passing the `$request` to the `$next` closure, like you would in a middleware.

```php
// in your spam responder
$regularResponse = $next($request)
```

### Customizing the generated honeypot fields

To customize output generated by `@honeypot` you can publish the `honeypot` view with:

```php
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Spatie\Honeypot\HoneypotServiceProvider --tags=views"
```

The view will be placed in `resources/views/vendor/honeypot/honeypotFormFields.blade.php`. This is the default content:

```php
@if($enabled)
    <div id="{{ $nameFieldName }}_wrap" style="display:none;">
        <input name="{{ $nameFieldName }}" type="text" value="" id="my_name">
        <input name="{{ $validFromFieldName }}" type="text" value="{{ $encrypedValidFrom }}">
    </div>
@endif
```

### Events fired

Whenever spam is detected, the `Spatie\Honeypot\SpamDetected` event is fired. It has the `$request` as a public property.

###Testing

``` bash
composer test
```
